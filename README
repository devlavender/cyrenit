cyrenit - a minimalist init system and supervisor
=================================================

cyrenit is a small experimental init program written in C. It provides a
tiny and simple process supervisor to start a set of services. It intends
to provide the basic infrastructure for an init (PID 1) program and have
a simple foundation for exploring post-boot semantics for the linux kernel.


WARNING: This is not intended for production, and this project is more of
a playground for exerimenting with init design and service launching,
signal handling, etc. It runs on a constrained initcpio image for now.

Building:
    run "make"

Running under QEMU:
    run "make run"

Installing into an initramfs:
    the Makefile will generate a minimal cpio archive containing ./init
