cyrenit - a minimalist init system and supervisor
=================================================

cyrenit is a small experimental init program written in C. It provides a
tiny and simple process supervisor to start a set of services. It intends
to provide the basic infrastructure for an init (PID 1) program and have
a simple foundation for exploring post-boot semantics for the linux kernel.


WARNING: This is not intended for production, and this project is more of
a playground for exerimenting with init design and service launching,
signal handling, etc. It runs on a constrained initcpio image for now.

REQUIREMENTS
To build cyrenit the requirements are:
- GNU make
- A C compiler (tested on gcc)
- A linker (tested on ld)
- cpio
- bash

To run cyrenit you will need:
- QEMU
- A kernel at your host's /boot/vmlinuz-linux (you can change the path on
the Makefile)

BUILDING
To build cyrenit run:
$ make

To build the initcpio run:
$ make initcpio

RUNNING
To run cyrenit, use the command:
$ make run
