cyrenit - a minimalist init system and supervisor
=================================================

cyrenit is a small experimental init program written in C. It provides a
tiny and simple process supervisor to start a set of services. It intends
to provide the basic infrastructure for an init (PID 1) program and have
a simple foundation for exploring post-boot semantics for the linux kernel.


WARNING: This is not intended for production, and this project is more of
a playground for exerimenting with init design and service launching,
signal handling, etc. It runs on a constrained initcpio image for now.

REQUIREMENTS
To build cyrenit the requirements are:
- GNU make
- A C compiler (tested on gcc)
- A linker (tested on ld)
- bash

To build an initcpio image you will need:
- cpio
- bash
- tools: ls, find, mount, umount, df, cp, mv, rm, dmesg, touch, cat,
  tail, ln, ps and kill (you'll likely have it, but might remove them
  from the Makefile IMAGE_BINS list as well if you don't have and don't
  want them)
- 

To run cyrenit you will need:
- QEMU
- A kernel at your host's /boot/vmlinuz-linux (you can change the path on
  the Makefile)

BUILDING
To build cyrenit run:
$ make

To build the initcpio run:
$ make initcpio

RUNNING
To run cyrenit, use the command:
$ make run

DEBUGGING
To build cyrenit with debug symbols, use `DEBUG=1` argument to `make`.
You can debug the CLI mode just running it regularly with `gdb`.

To debug it on PID1 mode, build it with debug symbols and then add the
`DEBUG=1` argument to `make run` as well. Qemu will then start and listen
on port 1234 so you can connect to it using gdb command:

`target remote :1234`

Then you start the execution with `continue`, although I'd recommend to
add some breakpoints before (i.e. `main`).
